        <h2>Help Feed a Family in Need</h2>
        <p>
          Each month, one family sponsors another family with a monthly contribution to Family-to-Family, a non-profit,
          national hunger relief program that provides needy American families with basic life necessities during
          difficult times. Recipient families are vetted, and groceries provided, by Family-to-Family. Or, volunteers
          can form a local chapter to send monthly food boxes to families in need. Local chapters typically include five
          to 10 families. Stron organizational skills are recommended for chapter initiation.
